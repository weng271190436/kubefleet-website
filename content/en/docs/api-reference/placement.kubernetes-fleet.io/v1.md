#### AppliedWork



AppliedWork represents an applied work on managed cluster that is placed
on a managed cluster. An appliedwork links to a work on a hub recording resources
deployed in the managed cluster.
When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
can delete appliedwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
The name of the appliedwork must be the same as {work name}
The namespace of the appliedwork should be the same as the resource applied on
the managed cluster.

#### ApplyStrategy



ApplyStrategy describes how to resolve the conflict if the resource to be placed already exists in the target cluster
and whether it's allowed to be co-owned by other non-fleet appliers.

#### ClusterResourceSnapshot



ClusterResourceSnapshot is used to store a snapshot of selected resources by a resource placement policy.
Its spec is immutable.
We may need to produce more than one resourceSnapshot for all the resources a ResourcePlacement selected to get around the 1MB size limit of k8s objects.
We assign an ever-increasing index for each such group of resourceSnapshots.
The naming convention of a clusterResourceSnapshot is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-{subindex}
where the name of the first snapshot of a group has no subindex part so its name is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-snapshot.
resourceIndex will begin with 0.
Each snapshot MUST have the following labels:
  - `CRPTrackingLabel` which points to its owner CRP.
  - `ResourceIndexLabel` which is the index  of the snapshot group.

The first snapshot of the index group MAY have the following labels:
  - `IsLatestSnapshotLabel` which indicates whether the snapshot is the latest one.

All the snapshots within the same index group must have the same ResourceIndexLabel.

The first snapshot of the index group MUST have the following annotations:
  - `NumberOfResourceSnapshotsAnnotation` to store the total number of resource snapshots in the index group.
  - `ResourceGroupHashAnnotation` whose value is the sha-256 hash of all the snapshots belong to the same snapshot index.

Each snapshot (excluding the first snapshot) MUST have the following annotations:
  - `SubindexOfResourceSnapshotAnnotation` to store the subindex of resource snapshot in the group.

Snapshot may have the following annotations to indicate the time of next resourceSnapshot candidate detected by the controller:
  - `NextResourceSnapshotCandidateDetectionTimeAnnotation` to store the time of next resourceSnapshot candidate detected by the controller.

Defaults to Equal.<br />Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a<br />ClusterResourcePlacement can tolerate all taints of a particular category. | Equal | Enum: [Equal Exists] <br /> |
| `value` _string_ | Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.<br />If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string. |  |  |
| `effect` _[TaintEffect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.31/#tainteffect-v1-core)_ | Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.<br />When specified, only allowed value is NoSchedule. |  | Enum: [NoSchedule] <br /> |


#### TopologySpreadConstraint



TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread resources among the given cluster topology.



_Appears in:_
- [PlacementPolicy](#placementpolicy)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxSkew` _integer_ | MaxSkew describes the degree to which resources may be unevenly distributed.<br />When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference<br />between the number of resource copies in the target topology and the global minimum.<br />The global minimum is the minimum number of resource copies in a domain.<br />When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence<br />to topologies that satisfy it.<br />It's an optional field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed. | 1 | Minimum: 1 <br /> |
| `topologyKey` _string_ | TopologyKey is the key of cluster labels. Clusters that have a label with this key<br />and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.<br />We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number<br />of replicas of the resource into each bucket honor the `MaxSkew` value.<br />It's a required field. |  |  |
| `whenUnsatisfiable` _[UnsatisfiableConstraintAction](#unsatisfiableconstraintaction)_ | WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with the resource if it doesn't satisfy<br />the spread constraint.<br />- DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.<br />- ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the resource in any cluster,<br />  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the skew.<br />It's an optional field. |  |  |


#### UnsatisfiableConstraintAction

_Underlying type:_ _string_

UnsatisfiableConstraintAction defines the type of actions that can be taken if a constraint is not satisfied.



_Appears in:_
- [TopologySpreadConstraint](#topologyspreadconstraint)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DoNotSchedule` | DoNotSchedule instructs the scheduler not to schedule the resource<br />onto the cluster when constraints are not satisfied.<br /> |
| `ScheduleAnyway` | ScheduleAnyway instructs the scheduler to schedule the resource<br />even if constraints are not satisfied.<br /> |

| `items` _[Work](#work) array_ | List of works. |  |  |


#### WorkResourceIdentifier



WorkResourceIdentifier provides the identifiers needed to interact with any arbitrary object.
Renamed original "ResourceIdentifier" so that it won't conflict with ResourceIdentifier defined in the clusterresourceplacement_types.go.



_Appears in:_
- [AppliedResourceMeta](#appliedresourcemeta)
- [ManifestCondition](#manifestcondition)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ordinal` _integer_ | Ordinal represents an index in manifests list, so the condition can still be linked<br />to a manifest even though manifest cannot be parsed successfully. |  |  |
| `group` _string_ | Group is the group of the resource. |  |  |
| `version` _string_ | Version is the version of the resource. |  |  |
| `kind` _string_ | Kind is the kind of the resource. |  |  |
| `resource` _string_ | Resource is the resource type of the resource |  |  |
| `namespace` _string_ | Namespace is the namespace of the resource, the resource is cluster scoped if the value<br />is empty |  |  |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the name of the resource |  |  |


#### WorkSpec



WorkSpec defines the desired state of Work.



_Appears in:_
- [Work](#work)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workload` _[WorkloadTemplate](#workloadtemplate)_ | Workload represents the manifest workload to be deployed on spoke cluster |  |  |
| `applyStrategy` _[ApplyStrategy](#applystrategy)_ | ApplyStrategy describes how to resolve the conflict if the resource to be placed already exists in the target cluster<br />and is owned by other appliers.<br />This field is a beta-level feature. |  |  |
