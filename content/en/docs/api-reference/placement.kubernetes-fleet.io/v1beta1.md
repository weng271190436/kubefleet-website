#### Affinity



Affinity is a group of cluster affinity scheduling rules. More to be added.



_Appears in:_
- [PlacementPolicy](#placementpolicy)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clusterAffinity` _[ClusterAffinity](#clusteraffinity)_ | ClusterAffinity contains cluster affinity scheduling rules for the selected resources. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |


#### AppliedResourceMeta



AppliedResourceMeta represents the group, version, resource, name and namespace of a resource.
Since these resources have been created, they must have valid group, version, resource, namespace, and name.



_Appears in:_
- [AppliedWorkStatus](#appliedworkstatus)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ordinal` _integer_ | Ordinal represents an index in manifests list, so the condition can still be linked<br />to a manifest even though manifest cannot be parsed successfully. |  |  |
| `group` _string_ | Group is the group of the resource. |  |  |
| `version` _string_ | Version is the version of the resource. |  |  |
| `kind` _string_ | Kind is the kind of the resource. |  |  |
| `resource` _string_ | Resource is the resource type of the resource. |  |  |
| `namespace` _string_ | Namespace is the namespace of the resource, the resource is cluster scoped if the value<br />is empty. |  |  |
| `name` _string_ | Name is the name of the resource. |  |  |
| `uid` _[UID](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.31/#uid-types-pkg)_ | UID is set on successful deletion of the Kubernetes resource by controller. The<br />resource might be still visible on the managed cluster after this field is set.<br />It is not directly settable by a client. |  |  |


#### AppliedWork



AppliedWork represents an applied work on managed cluster that is placed
on a managed cluster. An appliedwork links to a work on a hub recording resources
deployed in the managed cluster.
When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
can delete appliedwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
The name of the appliedwork must be the same as {work name}
The namespace of the appliedwork should be the same as the resource applied on
the managed cluster.

#### ApplyStrategy



ApplyStrategy describes when and how to apply the selected resource to the target cluster.
Note: If multiple CRPs try to place the same resource with different apply strategy, the later ones will fail with the
reason ApplyConflictBetweenPlacements.



_Appears in:_
- [ResourceBindingSpec](#resourcebindingspec)
- [RolloutStrategy](#rolloutstrategy)
- [UpdateRunStatus](#updaterunstatus)
- [WorkSpec](#workspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `comparisonOption` _[ComparisonOptionType](#comparisonoptiontype)_ | ComparisonOption controls how Fleet compares the desired state of a resource, as kept in<br />a hub cluster manifest, with the current state of the resource (if applicable) in the<br />member cluster.<br />Available options are:<br />* PartialComparison: with this option, Fleet will compare only fields that are managed by<br />  Fleet, i.e., the fields that are specified explicitly in the hub cluster manifest.<br />  Unmanaged fields are ignored. This is the default option.<br />* FullComparison: with this option, Fleet will compare all fields of the resource,<br />  even if the fields are absent from the hub cluster manifest.<br />Consider using the PartialComparison option if you would like to:<br />* use the default values for certain fields; or<br />* let another agent, e.g., HPAs, VPAs, etc., on the member cluster side manage some fields; or<br />* allow ad-hoc or cluster-specific settings on the member cluster side.<br />To use the FullComparison option, it is recommended that you:<br />* specify all fields as appropriate in the hub cluster, even if you are OK with using default<br />  values;<br />* make sure that no fields are managed by agents other than Fleet on the member cluster<br />  side, such as HPAs, VPAs, or other controllers.<br />See the Fleet documentation for further explanations and usage examples. | PartialComparison | Enum: [PartialComparison FullComparison] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `whenToApply` _[WhenToApplyType](#whentoapplytype)_ | WhenToApply controls when Fleet would apply the manifests on the hub cluster to the member<br />clusters.<br />Available options are:<br />* Always: with this option, Fleet will periodically apply hub cluster manifests<br />  on the member cluster side; this will effectively overwrite any change in the fields<br />  managed by Fleet (i.e., specified in the hub cluster manifest). This is the default<br />  option.<br />  Note that this option would revert any ad-hoc changes made on the member cluster side in the<br />  managed fields; if you would like to make temporary edits on the member cluster side<br />  in the managed fields, switch to IfNotDrifted option. Note that changes in unmanaged<br />  fields will be left alone; if you use the FullDiff compare option, such changes will<br />  be reported as drifts.<br />* IfNotDrifted: with this option, Fleet will stop applying hub cluster manifests on<br />  clusters that have drifted from the desired state; apply ops would still continue on<br />  the rest of the clusters. Drifts are calculated using the ComparisonOption,<br />  as explained in the corresponding field.<br />  Use this option if you would like Fleet to detect drifts in your multi-cluster setup.<br />  A drift occurs when an agent makes an ad-hoc change on the member cluster side that<br />  makes affected resources deviate from its desired state as kept in the hub cluster;<br />  and this option grants you an opportunity to view the drift details and take actions<br />  accordingly. The drift details will be reported in the CRP status.<br />  To fix a drift, you may:<br />  * revert the changes manually on the member cluster side<br />  * update the hub cluster manifest; this will trigger Fleet to apply the latest revision<br />    of the manifests, which will overwrite the drifted fields<br />    (if they are managed by Fleet)<br />  * switch to the Always option; this will trigger Fleet to apply the current revision<br />    of the manifests, which will overwrite the drifted fields (if they are managed by Fleet).<br />  * if applicable and necessary, delete the drifted resources on the member cluster side; Fleet<br />    will attempt to re-create them using the hub cluster manifests | Always | Enum: [Always IfNotDrifted] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `type` _[ApplyStrategyType](#applystrategytype)_ | Type is the apply strategy to use; it determines how Fleet applies manifests from the<br />hub cluster to a member cluster.<br />Available options are:<br />* ClientSideApply: Fleet uses three-way merge to apply manifests, similar to how kubectl<br />  performs a client-side apply. This is the default option.<br />  Note that this strategy requires that Fleet keep the last applied configuration in the<br />  annotation of an applied resource. If the object gets so large that apply ops can no longer<br />  be executed, Fleet will switch to server-side apply.<br />  Use ComparisonOption and WhenToApply settings to control when an apply op can be executed.<br />* ServerSideApply: Fleet uses server-side apply to apply manifests; Fleet itself will<br />  become the field manager for specified fields in the manifests. Specify<br />  ServerSideApplyConfig as appropriate if you would like Fleet to take over field<br />  ownership upon conflicts. This is the recommended option for most scenarios; it might<br />  help reduce object size and safely resolve conflicts between field values. For more<br />  information, please refer to the Kubernetes documentation<br />  (https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#comparison-with-client-side-apply).<br />  Use ComparisonOption and WhenToApply settings to control when an apply op can be executed.<br />* ReportDiff: Fleet will compare the desired state of a resource as kept in the hub cluster<br />  with its current state (if applicable) on the member cluster side, and report any<br />  differences. No actual apply ops would be executed, and resources will be left alone as they<br />  are on the member clusters.<br />  If configuration differences are found on a resource, Fleet will consider this as an apply<br />  error, which might block rollout depending on the specified rollout strategy.<br />  Use ComparisonOption setting to control how the difference is calculated.<br />ClientSideApply and ServerSideApply apply strategies only work when Fleet can assume<br />ownership of a resource (e.g., the resource is created by Fleet, or Fleet has taken over<br />the resource). See the comments on the WhenToTakeOver field for more information.<br />ReportDiff apply strategy, however, will function regardless of Fleet's ownership<br />status. One may set up a CRP with the ReportDiff strategy and the Never takeover option,<br />and this will turn Fleet into a detection tool that reports only configuration differences<br />but do not touch any resources on the member cluster side.<br />For a comparison between the different strategies and usage examples, refer to the<br />Fleet documentation. | ClientSideApply | Enum: [ClientSideApply ServerSideApply ReportDiff] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `allowCoOwnership` _boolean_ | AllowCoOwnership controls whether co-ownership between Fleet and other agents are allowed<br />on a Fleet-managed resource. If set to false, Fleet will refuse to apply manifests to<br />a resource that has been owned by one or more non-Fleet agents.<br />Note that Fleet does not support the case where one resource is being placed multiple<br />times by different CRPs on the same member cluster. An apply error will be returned if<br />Fleet finds that a resource has been owned by another placement attempt by Fleet, even<br />with the AllowCoOwnership setting set to true. |  |  |
| `serverSideApplyConfig` _[ServerSideApplyConfig](#serversideapplyconfig)_ | ServerSideApplyConfig defines the configuration for server side apply. It is honored only when type is ServerSideApply. |  | Optional: \{\} <br /> |
| `whenToTakeOver` _[WhenToTakeOverType](#whentotakeovertype)_ | WhenToTakeOver determines the action to take when Fleet applies resources to a member<br />cluster for the first time and finds out that the resource already exists in the cluster.<br />This setting is most relevant in cases where you would like Fleet to manage pre-existing<br />resources on a member cluster.<br />Available options include:<br />* Always: with this action, Fleet will apply the hub cluster manifests to the member<br />  clusters even if the affected resources already exist. This is the default action.<br />  Note that this might lead to fields being overwritten on the member clusters, if they<br />  are specified in the hub cluster manifests.<br />* IfNoDiff: with this action, Fleet will apply the hub cluster manifests to the member<br />  clusters if (and only if) pre-existing resources look the same as the hub cluster manifests.<br />  This is a safer option as pre-existing resources that are inconsistent with the hub cluster<br />  manifests will not be overwritten; Fleet will ignore them until the inconsistencies<br />  are resolved properly: any change you make to the hub cluster manifests would not be<br />  applied, and if you delete the manifests or even the ClusterResourcePlacement itself<br />  from the hub cluster, these pre-existing resources would not be taken away.<br />  Fleet will check for inconsistencies in accordance with the ComparisonOption setting. See also<br />  the comments on the ComparisonOption field for more information.<br />  If a diff has been found in a field that is **managed** by Fleet (i.e., the field<br />  **is specified ** in the hub cluster manifest), consider one of the following actions:<br />  * set the field in the member cluster to be of the same value as that in the hub cluster<br />    manifest.<br />  * update the hub cluster manifest so that its field value matches with that in the member<br />    cluster.<br />  * switch to the Always action, which will allow Fleet to overwrite the field with the<br />    value in the hub cluster manifest.<br />  If a diff has been found in a field that is **not managed** by Fleet (i.e., the field<br />  **is not specified** in the hub cluster manifest), consider one of the following actions:<br />  * remove the field from the member cluster.<br />  * update the hub cluster manifest so that the field is included in the hub cluster manifest.<br />  If appropriate, you may also delete the object from the member cluster; Fleet will recreate<br />  it using the hub cluster manifest.<br />* Never: with this action, Fleet will not apply a hub cluster manifest to the member<br />  clusters if there is a corresponding pre-existing resource. However, if a manifest<br />  has never been applied yet; or it has a corresponding resource which Fleet has assumed<br />  ownership, apply op will still be executed.<br />  This is the safest option; one will have to remove the pre-existing resources (so that<br />  Fleet can re-create them) or switch to a different<br />  WhenToTakeOver option before Fleet starts processing the corresponding hub cluster<br />  manifests.<br />  If you prefer Fleet stop processing all manifests, use this option along with the<br />  ReportDiff apply strategy type. This setup would instruct Fleet to touch nothing<br />  on the member cluster side but still report configuration differences between the<br />  hub cluster and member clusters. Fleet will not give up ownership<br />  that it has already assumed though. | Always | Enum: [Always IfNoDiff Never] <br />Optional: \{\} <br /> |

ClusterResourcePlacement is used to select cluster scoped resources, including built-in resources and custom resources,
and placement them onto selected member clusters in a fleet.

If a namespace is selected, ALL the resources under the namespace are placed to the target clusters.
Note that you can't select the following resources:
  - reserved namespaces including: default, kube-* (reserved for Kubernetes system namespaces),
    fleet-* (reserved for fleet system namespaces).
  - reserved fleet resource types including: MemberCluster, InternalMemberCluster, ClusterResourcePlacement,
    ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot, ClusterResourceSnapshot, ClusterResourceBinding, etc.

`ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` and `ClusterResourceSnapshot` objects are created when there are changes in the
system to keep the history of the changes affecting a `ClusterResourcePlacement`.

#### ClusterResourcePlacementDisruptionBudget



ClusterResourcePlacementDisruptionBudget is the policy applied to a ClusterResourcePlacement
object that specifies its disruption budget, i.e., how many placements (clusters) can be
down at the same time due to voluntary disruptions (e.g., evictions). Involuntary
disruptions are not subject to this budget, but will still count against it.

To apply a ClusterResourcePlacementDisruptionBudget to a ClusterResourcePlacement, use the
same name for the ClusterResourcePlacementDisruptionBudget object as the ClusterResourcePlacement
object. This guarantees a 1:1 link between the two objects.

#### ClusterResourcePlacementEviction



ClusterResourcePlacementEviction is an eviction attempt on a specific placement from
a ClusterResourcePlacement object; one may use this API to force the removal of specific
resources from a cluster.

An eviction is a voluntary disruption; its execution is subject to the disruption budget
linked with the target ClusterResourcePlacement object (if present).

Beware that an eviction alone does not guarantee that a placement will not re-appear; i.e.,
after an eviction, the Fleet scheduler might still pick the previous target cluster for
placement. To prevent this, considering adding proper taints to the target cluster before running
an eviction that will exclude it from future placements; this is especially true in scenarios
where one would like to perform a cluster replacement.

For safety reasons, Fleet will only execute an eviction once; the spec in this object is immutable,
and once executed, the object will be ignored after. To trigger another eviction attempt on the
same placement from the same ClusterResourcePlacement object, one must re-create (delete and
create) the same Eviction object. Note also that an Eviction object will be
ignored once it is deemed invalid (e.g., such an object might be targeting a CRP object or
a placement that does not exist yet), even if it does become valid later
(e.g., the CRP object or the placement appears later). To fix the situation, re-create the
Eviction object.

Note: Eviction of resources from a cluster propagated by a PickFixed CRP is not allowed.
If the user wants to remove resources from a cluster propagated by a PickFixed CRP simply
remove the cluster name from cluster names field from the CRP spec.

Executed evictions might be kept around for a while for auditing purposes; the Fleet controllers might
have a TTL set up for such objects and will garbage collect them automatically. For further
information, see the Fleet documentation.

#### ClusterResourcePlacementStatus



ClusterResourcePlacementStatus is a namespaced resource that mirrors the PlacementStatus of a corresponding
ClusterResourcePlacement object. This allows namespace-scoped access to cluster-scoped placement status.
The LastUpdatedTime field is updated whenever the CRPS object is updated.

This object will be created within the target namespace that contains resources being managed by the CRP.
When multiple ClusterResourcePlacements target the same namespace, each ClusterResourcePlacementStatus within that
namespace is uniquely identified by its object name, which corresponds to the specific ClusterResourcePlacement
that created it.

The name of this object should be the same as the name of the corresponding ClusterResourcePlacement.

#### ClusterResourceSnapshot



ClusterResourceSnapshot is used to store a snapshot of selected resources by a resource placement policy.
Its spec is immutable.
We may need to produce more than one resourceSnapshot for all the resources a ResourcePlacement selected to get around the 1MB size limit of k8s objects.
We assign an ever-increasing index for each such group of resourceSnapshots.
The naming convention of a clusterResourceSnapshot is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-{subindex}
where the name of the first snapshot of a group has no subindex part so its name is {CRPName}-{resourceIndex}-snapshot.
resourceIndex will begin with 0.
Each snapshot MUST have the following labels:
  - `CRPTrackingLabel` which points to its owner CRP.
  - `ResourceIndexLabel` which is the index  of the snapshot group.
  - `IsLatestSnapshotLabel` which indicates whether the snapshot is the latest one.

All the snapshots within the same index group must have the same ResourceIndexLabel.

The first snapshot of the index group MUST have the following annotations:
  - `NumberOfResourceSnapshotsAnnotation` to store the total number of resource snapshots in the index group.
  - `ResourceGroupHashAnnotation` whose value is the sha-256 hash of all the snapshots belong to the same snapshot index.

Each snapshot (excluding the first snapshot) MUST have the following annotations:
  - `SubindexOfResourceSnapshotAnnotation` to store the subindex of resource snapshot in the group.

Snapshot may have the following annotations to indicate the time of next resourceSnapshot candidate detected by the controller:
  - `NextResourceSnapshotCandidateDetectionTimeAnnotation` to store the time of next resourceSnapshot candidate detected by the controller.

ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot is used to store a snapshot of cluster placement policy.
Its spec is immutable.

PolicySnapshotIndex will begin with 0.
Each snapshot must have the following labels:
  - `CRPTrackingLabel` which points to its owner CRP.
  - `PolicyIndexLabel` which is the index of the policy snapshot.

#### StagedUpdateRun



StagedUpdateRun represents a stage by stage update process that applies ResourcePlacement
selected resources to specified clusters.
Resources from unselected clusters are removed after all stages in the update strategy are completed.
Each StagedUpdateRun object corresponds to a single release of a specific resource version.
The release is abandoned if the StagedUpdateRun object is deleted or the scheduling decision changes.
The name of the StagedUpdateRun must conform to RFC 1123.

#### WhenToApplyType

_Underlying type:_ _string_

WhenToApplyType describes when Fleet would apply the manifests on the hub cluster to
the member clusters.



_Appears in:_
- [ApplyStrategy](#applystrategy)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Always` | WhenToApplyTypeAlways instructs Fleet to periodically apply hub cluster manifests<br />on the member cluster side; this will effectively overwrite any change in the fields<br />managed by Fleet (i.e., specified in the hub cluster manifest).<br /> |
| `IfNotDrifted` | WhenToApplyTypeIfNotDrifted instructs Fleet to stop applying hub cluster manifests on<br />clusters that have drifted from the desired state; apply ops would still continue on<br />the rest of the clusters.<br /> |


#### WhenToTakeOverType

_Underlying type:_ _string_

WhenToTakeOverType describes the type of the action to take when we first apply the
resources to the member cluster.



_Appears in:_
- [ApplyStrategy](#applystrategy)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IfNoDiff` | WhenToTakeOverTypeIfNoDiff instructs Fleet to apply a manifest with a corresponding<br />pre-existing resource on a member cluster if and only if the pre-existing resource<br />looks the same as the manifest. Should there be any inconsistency, Fleet will skip<br />the apply op; no change will be made on the resource and Fleet will not claim<br />ownership on it.<br />Note that this will not stop Fleet from processing other manifests in the same<br />placement that do not concern the takeover process (e.g., the manifests that have<br />not been created yet, or that are already under the management of Fleet).<br /> |
| `Always` | WhenToTakeOverTypeAlways instructs Fleet to always apply manifests to a member cluster,<br />even if there are some corresponding pre-existing resources. Some fields on these<br />resources might be overwritten, and Fleet will claim ownership on them.<br /> |
| `Never` | WhenToTakeOverTypeNever instructs Fleet to never apply a manifest to a member cluster<br />if there is a corresponding pre-existing resource.<br />Note that this will not stop Fleet from processing other manifests in the same placement<br />that do not concern the takeover process (e.g., the manifests that have not been created<br />yet, or that are already under the management of Fleet).<br />If you would like Fleet to stop processing manifests all together and do not assume<br />ownership on any pre-existing resources, use this option along with the ReportDiff<br />apply strategy type. This setup would instruct Fleet to touch nothing on the member<br />cluster side but still report configuration differences between the hub cluster<br />and member clusters. Fleet will not give up ownership that it has already assumed, though.<br /> |
