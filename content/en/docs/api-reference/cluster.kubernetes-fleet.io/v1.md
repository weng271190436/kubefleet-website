#### PropertyName

_Underlying type:_ _string_

PropertyName is the name of a cluster property.

A valid name should be a string of one or more segments, separated by slashes (/) if applicable.

Each segment must be 63 characters or less, start and end with an alphanumeric character,
and can include dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics in between.

Optionally, the property name can have a prefix, which must be a DNS subdomain up to 253 characters,
followed by a slash (/).

Examples include:
- "avg-resource-pressure"
- "kubernetes-fleet.io/node-count"
- "kubernetes.azure.com/vm-sizes/Standard_D2s_v3/count"
