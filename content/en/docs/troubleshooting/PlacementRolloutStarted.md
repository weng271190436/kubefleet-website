description: Troubleshooting guide for "RolloutStarted" condition set to false (ClusterResourcePlacementRolloutStarted / ResourcePlacementRolloutStarted)
weight: 3
---

When using placement APIs (ClusterResourcePlacement or ResourcePlacement) to propagate resources, selected resources may not begin rolling out and the `RolloutStarted` condition shows `False`.

*This guidance applies to the `RollingUpdate` strategy (default). For the explicit staged rollout (`External` on ClusterResourcePlacement), see the [Staged Update Run Troubleshooting Guide](ClusterStagedUpdateRun).* 

> Note: To get more information about why the rollout doesn't start, you can check the [rollout controller](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/pkg/controllers/rollout/controller.go) to get more information on why the rollout did not start.

## Common scenarios
Instances where this condition may arise:
- The rollout strategy is blocked (e.g. `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` calculations prevent progress).
- A prior phase (scheduling, overrides, work sync) is still incomplete.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Inspect placement `placementStatuses` for clusters with `RolloutStarted` `False`.
2. Retrieve the binding (`ClusterResourceBinding` for CRP, `ResourceBinding` for RP) and confirm Work creation/update status.
3. Recalculate expected `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` (defaults: 25% rounded) to ensure at least one binding can advance.

## Case Study

Example: A `ClusterResourcePlacement` attempts to propagate a namespace to three clusters but only two exist; the same pattern would apply to RP with namespace-scoped resources.
However, during the initial creation of the `ClusterResourcePlacement`, the namespace didn't exist on the hub cluster, 
and the fleet currently comprises two member clusters named `kind-cluster-1` and `kind-cluster-2`.

The output indicates the namespace does not yet exist on the hub cluster and shows these condition statuses:
- `ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled` is set to `False`, as the specified policy aims to pick three clusters, but the scheduler can only accommodate placement in two currently available and joined clusters.
- `ClusterResourcePlacementRolloutStarted` is set to `True`, as the rollout process has commenced with 2 clusters being selected.
- `ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden` is set to `True`, as no override rules are configured for the selected resources.
- `ClusterResourcePlacementWorkSynchronized` is set to `True`.
- `ClusterResourcePlacementApplied` is set to `True`.
- `ClusterResourcePlacementAvailable` is set to `True`.


Create the `test-ns` namespace on the hub cluster so it can be included in a new resource snapshot.

`Scheduled` remains `False` (insufficient clusters) and `RolloutStarted` becomes `False` due to strategy blocking.

Let's check the latest `ClusterResourceSnapshot`.

Check the latest `ClusterResourceSnapshot` by running the command in [How can I find the latest ClusterResourceSnapshot resource?](README.md#how-can-I-find-the-latest-ClusterResourceSnapshot-resource).

Upon inspecting `ClusterResourceSnapshot` spec, the `selectedResources` section now shows the namespace `test-ns`.

Check the binding for `kind-cluster-1` to verify whether its snapshot reference updated.

```

The binding still references the old snapshot (`resourceSnapshotName` unchanged).

Cause: default `RollingUpdate` values constrain progress:

- The `maxUnavailable` value is configured to 25% x 3 (desired number), rounded to `1`
- The `maxSurge` value is configured to 25% x 3 (desired number), rounded to `1`

### Why ClusterResourceBinding isn't updated?
Initially two bindings were generated; rollout began for existing resources.

After namespace creation the controller attempted to update both bindings but `maxUnavailable=1` prevented simultaneous update.
> NOTE: During the update, if one of the bindings fails to apply, it will also violate the `RollingUpdate` configuration, which causes `maxUnavailable` to be set to `1`.

### Resolution
Increase `maxUnavailable` (or adjust `maxSurge`) to allow at least one binding update, or join an additional member cluster. For ResourcePlacement identical calculations apply for namespace-scoped rollouts.
