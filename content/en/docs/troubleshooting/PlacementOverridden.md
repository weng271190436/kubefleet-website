description: Troubleshooting guide for "Overridden" condition set to false (ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden / ResourcePlacementOverridden)
weight: 4
---

The `ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden` (CRP) or `ResourcePlacementOverridden` (RP) condition is `False` when an override operation fails.
> Note: To get more information, look into the logs for the overrider controller (includes 
> controller for [ClusterResourceOverride](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/pkg/controllers/overrider/clusterresource_controller.go) and 
> [ResourceOverride](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/pkg/controllers/overrider/resource_controller.go)).

## Common scenarios
Instances where this condition may arise:
- A `ClusterResourceOverride` / `ResourceOverride` (or its snapshot) has an invalid JSON patch path or value.
- Target resource does not match selectors (no object to override).
- Override attempts to modify immutable fields.

## Case Study
Example: Attempting to override a ClusterRole via `ClusterResourceOverride` using an invalid JSON Patch path.

### ClusterRole
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2024-05-14T15:36:48Z"
    name: secret-reader
    resourceVersion: "81334"
    uid: 108e6312-3416-49be-aa3d-a665c5df58b4
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
    resources:
  - secrets
    verbs:
  - get
  - watch
  - list
```
The `ClusterRole` `secret-reader` that is being propagated to the member clusters by the `ClusterResourcePlacement`.

### ClusterResourceOverride spec
```
spec:
  clusterResourceSelectors:
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: secret-reader
    version: v1
  policy:
    overrideRules:
    - clusterSelector:
        clusterSelectorTerms:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              env: canary
      jsonPatchOverrides:
      - op: add
        path: /metadata/labels/new-label
        value: new-value
```
The `ClusterResourceOverride` is created to override the `ClusterRole` `secret-reader` by adding a new label (`new-label`)
that has the value `new-value` for the clusters with the label `env: canary`.

### ClusterResourcePlacement Spec
```
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: secret-reader
      version: v1
  policy:
    placementType: PickN
    numberOfClusters: 1
    affinity:
      clusterAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  env: canary
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    applyStrategy:
      allowCoOwnership: true
```

### ClusterResourcePlacement Status (Representative Example)
```
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-14T16:16:18Z"
    message: found all cluster needed as specified by the scheduling policy, found
      1 cluster(s)

  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-14T16:16:18Z"
    message: All 1 cluster(s) start rolling out the latest resource
    observedGeneration: 1

    status: "True"
    type: ClusterResourcePlacementRolloutStarted

    message: Failed to override resources in 1 cluster(s)
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: OverriddenFailed
    status: "False"
    type: ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden
  observedResourceIndex: "0"
  placementStatuses:
  - applicableClusterResourceOverrides:
    - cro-1-0
    clusterName: kind-cluster-1
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-14T16:16:18Z"
      message: 'Successfully scheduled resources for placement in kind-cluster-1 (affinity
        score: 0, topology spread score: 0): picked by scheduling policy'
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Scheduled
      status: "True"
      type: Scheduled
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-14T16:16:18Z"
      message: Detected the new changes on the resources and started the rollout process
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: RolloutStarted
      status: "True"
      type: RolloutStarted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-05-14T16:16:18Z"
      message: 'Failed to apply the override rules on the resources: add operation
        does not apply: doc is missing path: "/metadata/labels/new-label": missing
        value'
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: OverriddenFailed
      status: "False"
      type: Overridden
  selectedResources:
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: secret-reader
    version: v1
```
The placement attempted to apply override rules but `Overridden` is `False`; inspecting the per-cluster `Overridden` condition message pinpoints the failing JSON patch.

The message shows the patch path `/metadata/labels/new-label` is invalid because `labels` does not yet exist. Creating the parent map first (or patching `/metadata/labels`) resolves the issue.

### Resolution
Correct the JSON patch to create the labels map before adding keys:
```
jsonPatchOverrides:
  - op: add
    path: /metadata/labels
    value: 
      newlabel: new-value
```
This creates the `labels` map and adds `newlabel: new-value` to it.

## General Notes
For ResourcePlacement the override flow is identical; use `ResourceOverride` instead of `ClusterResourceOverride` and expect `ResourcePlacementOverridden` in conditions.
