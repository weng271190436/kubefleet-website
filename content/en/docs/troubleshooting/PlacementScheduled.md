description: Troubleshooting guide for "Scheduled" condition set to false (ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled / ResourcePlacementScheduled)
weight: 2
---

The `ClusterResourcePlacementScheduled` (for ClusterResourcePlacement) or `ResourcePlacementScheduled` (for ResourcePlacement) condition is set to `false` when the scheduler cannot find all the clusters needed as specified by the scheduling policy.
> Note: To get more information about why the scheduling fails, you can check the [scheduler](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/blob/main/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go) logs.

## Common scenarios

Instances where this condition may arise:

- When the placement policy is set to `PickFixed`, but the specified cluster names do not match any joined member cluster name in the fleet, or the specified cluster is no longer connected to the fleet.
- When the placement policy is set to `PickN`, and N clusters are specified, but there are fewer than N clusters that have joined the fleet or satisfy the placement policy.
- When the placement resource selector selects a reserved namespace.

> Note: When the placement policy is set to `PickAll`, the `Scheduled` condition is always set to `True`.

## Case Study

In the following example, a `ClusterResourcePlacement` with a `PickN` placement policy is trying to propagate resources to two clusters labeled `env:prod`. (The same scheduling logic applies to `ResourcePlacement`.)
The two clusters, named `kind-cluster-1` and `kind-cluster-2`, have joined the fleet. However, only one member cluster, `kind-cluster-1`, has the label `env:prod`.

```

The `Scheduled` condition is set to `False`; the goal is to select two clusters with the label `env:prod`, but only one member cluster possesses the correct label as specified in `clusterAffinity`.

You can inspect the scheduling policy snapshot to understand why clusters were (not) selected:
- For ClusterResourcePlacement: use `ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` (see guidance in the main TSG).
- For ResourcePlacement: use `SchedulingPolicySnapshot`.

The corresponding `ClusterSchedulingPolicySnapshot` spec and status gives us even more information on why scheduling failed.

```

### Resolution
Add the missing label (`env:prod`) to `kind-cluster-2` so it satisfies the affinity terms, or relax the affinity rules. The same approach applies for a `ResourcePlacement` where insufficient clusters match namespace-scoped criteria.

## General Notes
The scheduling failure investigation flow is identical for ClusterResourcePlacement and ResourcePlacement; only the snapshot object kind differs. Replace CRP-specific object kinds with their RP equivalents when working with namespace-scoped placements.
